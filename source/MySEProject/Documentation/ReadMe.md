# Project Description


Boosting Algorithm uses Spatial Pooler and Spatial Pattern learning, This algorithm uses internally a boosting algorithm which makes sure that the unused mini columns and weak synapses periodically get boosted.

The main idea behind boosting is that the SDR's of symbols uses a wider range of cells by making the most active cells less active and least active cells more active. This is done via scalar multiplication of a boosting matrix over the spatial pooler to change permeances of each cell.

## 1. Objective


- Is to Analyse which methods are related to boosting.

- Identify which parameters of the HtmConfig class are used by the boosting algorithm.

- Execute SpatialLearning experiment and document what changes when changing some of boosting relevant parameters.

- and to Document boosting

## 2. Approach

### 2b Code wrtten to generate CSV files for each method used.

- Generated CSV files for individual methods mentioned below with necessary data which will help in the analysis of boosting algorithm. 
- In Spatial Pooler '2 types' of methods are used boosting algorithm.
Those methods are as follows:

### Synaptic Boost of inactive mini-columns
A mini-column is defined as inactive (weak) if the number of its connected synapses at the proximal dendrite segment is not sufficient in a learning cycle. If the number of connected synapses of a mini-column in the cycle to the current input is less than the stimulus threshold, then permanence values of all potential synapses of a mini-column will be slightly incremented by parameter si (stimulus increment).

 - ### Bump Up Weak Columns comes under Synaptic boosting:

### Uniform Activation of mini-columns

The second part of the plasticity implementation makes sure that all mini-columns in the HTM area become uniformly activated and following 3 comes under this.

- ### Update Duty Cycles :

- ### Update Min Duty Cycles :

## Unit- Test for each Method

### 1. BumpUpWeakColoumns.

This method increases the permanence values of synapses of columns whose overlap level is too low. Such columns are identified by having an overlap duty cycle (activation frequency) that drops too much below those of their peers. The permanence values for such columns are increased.

#### Description: 

- First by using the parameters setInputDimensions and setColumnDimensions we set the test synapses of columns. In case1 we considered SynPermBelowStimulusInc = 0.01; and SynPermTrimThreshold = 0.05;

- Then the following condition is tested on a pool of test permanence values(testingpermanences):

**Condition :** If 'OverlapDutyCycles < MinOverlapDutyCycles' the column is considered as a weak column and hence the permanence values of synapses of columns are increased. Using this condition Expected permanences are calculated.
```csharp 
mem.HtmConfig.OverlapDutyCycles = new double[] { 0, 0.009, 0.1, 0.001, 0.002 };
mem.HtmConfig.MinOverlapDutyCycles = new double[] { .01, .01, .01, .01, .01 };
```
- Both the test and expected pool of permanence values are fed into the Bumpupweakcoloumns method in spacial pooler to compare and conclude the test case.
```csharp
sp.BumpUpWeakColumns(mem);
for (int i = 0; i < mem.HtmConfig.NumColumns; i++)
{
double[] calculatedperms = mem.GetColumn(i).ProximalDendrite.RFPool.GetDensePermanences(mem.HtmConfig.NumInputs);
for (int j = 0; j < ExpectedPermanences[i].Length; j++)
{
Assert.IsTrue(Math.Abs(ExpectedPermanences[i][j] - calculatedperms[j]) <= 0.01);
}
```

#### 1a. SynPermBelowStimulusInc :

Synapses of weak mini-columns will be stimulated by the boosting mechanism. The stimulation is done by adding of this increment value to the current permanence value of the synapse.

#### 1b. SynPermTrimThreshold :

This value is used by SP. When some permanence is under this value, it is set on zero. In this case the synapse remains the potential one and still can participate in learning. By following structural plasticity principal the synapse would become disconnected from the mini-column.

**Case1:** 
Tested if the permanence values are getting updated correctly in Bumpupweakcoloumns method with 
SynPermBelowStimulusInc = 0.01;
SynPermTrimThreshold = 0.05;

[link to the case1 code](https://github.com/sandhyabagadi/neocortexapi/blob/be591e016338b1e2f28751e27094c1f962109f89/source/MySEProject/Unit-Tests/SpacialPoolerBumpUpWeakColoumns-Unit-Test.cs#L52)

**Case2:** 
Testing to make sure the permanence values doesn’t get updated when all OverlapDutyCycles are greater than MinOverlapDutyCycles (as it will not be considered as a weak column with this condition the permanence values won’t get updated).

[link to the case2 code](https://github.com/sandhyabagadi/neocortexapi/blob/be591e016338b1e2f28751e27094c1f962109f89/source/MySEProject/Unit-Tests/SpacialPoolerBumpUpWeakColoumns-Unit-Test.cs#L188)

### 2. UpdateBoostFactor.

The boost factors are used to increase the overlap of active columns to improve their chances of becoming active and hence encourage participation of more columns in the learning process. This means that columns that have been active enough have a boost factor of 1, meaning their overlap is not boosted. Columns whose active-duty cycle drops too much below that of their neighbours are boosted depending on how infrequently they have been active. The more infrequent, the more they are boosted.

**Formula :** ` boost =(1-maxBoost)/minDuty*activeDutyCycle + maxBoost `

[link to UpdateBoostFactorUnitTest](https://github.com/sandhyabagadi/neocortexapi/blob/be591e016338b1e2f28751e27094c1f962109f89/source/MySEProject/Unit-Tests/SpacialpoolerUpdateBoostfactor-Unit-Test.cs#L52)

#### MaxBoost: 
The Maximum overlap boost factor, Each columns overlap gets multiplied by a boost factor before its considered for inhibition. The actual boost factor for a column is between 1.0 and the maxboost.

**Case1:** 
Tested Boost Factors are updated as per the mathematical formula defined in UpdateBoostFactors method with maxboost 10

[Link to case1 code](https://github.com/sandhyabagadi/neocortexapi/blob/be591e016338b1e2f28751e27094c1f962109f89/source/MySEProject/Unit-Tests/SpacialpoolerUpdateBoostfactor-Unit-Test.cs#L52)

**Case2:** 
Tested Boost Factors are updated as per the mathematical formula defined in UpdateBoostFactors method with maxboost 1

[Link to case2 code](https://github.com/sandhyabagadi/neocortexapi/blob/be591e016338b1e2f28751e27094c1f962109f89/source/MySEProject/Unit-Tests/SpacialpoolerUpdateBoostfactor-Unit-Test.cs#L128)

**Case3:** 
Tested Boost Factors are not updated when all minActiveDutyCycles are 0 ( A boost factor of 1.0 is used if the duty cycle is >= minOverlapDutycycle )

[Link to case3 code](https://github.com/sandhyabagadi/neocortexapi/blob/be591e016338b1e2f28751e27094c1f962109f89/source/MySEProject/Unit-Tests/SpacialpoolerUpdateBoostfactor-Unit-Test.cs#L89)

### 3. CalcEventFrequency.


Calculates the normalised counter value of the frequency of an event. Event can be overlap or the activation of the column.  Updates a duty cycle estimate with a new value. This is a helper function that is used to update several duty cycle variables in the Column class, such as: overlapDutyCucle, activeDutyCycle, minPctDutyCycleBeforeInh, minPctDutyCycleAfterInh, etc. returns the updated duty cycle.


   ` dutyCycle = (period - 1)*dutyCycle + newValue / period `       
                  

[link to CalcEventFrequencyUnitTest](https://github.com/sandhyabagadi/neocortexapi/blob/be591e016338b1e2f28751e27094c1f962109f89/source/MySEProject/Unit-Tests/SpacialpoolerCalcEventFrequency-Unit-Test.cs#L80)             

**Case1:** 
Tested duty cycles are updated as per the mathematical formula defined in CalcEventFrequency method with period 1000

[Link to case1 code](https://github.com/sandhyabagadi/neocortexapi/blob/be591e016338b1e2f28751e27094c1f962109f89/source/MySEProject/Unit-Tests/SpacialpoolerCalcEventFrequency-Unit-Test.cs#L80)

**Case2:** 
Tested duty cycles are updated as per the mathematical formula defined in CalcEventFrequency method with period 1

[Link to case2 code](https://github.com/sandhyabagadi/neocortexapi/blob/be591e016338b1e2f28751e27094c1f962109f89/source/MySEProject/Unit-Tests/SpacialpoolerCalcEventFrequency-Unit-Test.cs#L109)

### 4. UpdateMinDutyCycles.

It updates the minimum duty cycles for SP that uses global inhibition and sets the minimum duty cycles for the overlap and activation of all columns to be a percent of the maximum in the region, specified by Min Overlap Duty Cycles and min Pct Active-Duty Cycle respectively.

**Description :**

Whenever the UpdateMinDutyCycles method is called in the SP its either Local or Global Inhibition. Through inhibition radius we get the size of the local neighborhood, Then the Maximum value in the neighborhood of maxActiveDuty and maxOverlapDuty is multiplied with MinPctActiveDutyCycles and MinPctOverlapDutyCycles Respectively to be a percent of the maximum in the region.

```csharp 
{
int[] neighborhood = GetColumnNeighborhood(c, i, this.InhibitionRadius);

double maxActiveDuty = ArrayUtils.Max(ArrayUtils.ListOfValuesByIndicies(c.HtmConfig.ActiveDutyCycles, neighborhood));
double maxOverlapDuty = ArrayUtils.Max(ArrayUtils.ListOfValuesByIndicies(c.HtmConfig.OverlapDutyCycles, neighborhood));

c.HtmConfig.MinActiveDutyCycles[i] = maxActiveDuty * c.HtmConfig.MinPctActiveDutyCycles;

c.HtmConfig.MinOverlapDutyCycles[i] = maxOverlapDuty * c.HtmConfig.MinPctOverlapDutyCycles;
```
[link to UpdateMinDutyCyclesUnitTest](https://github.com/sandhyabagadi/neocortexapi/blob/be591e016338b1e2f28751e27094c1f962109f89/source/MySEProject/Unit-Tests/SpacialPoolerUpdateMinDutyCycles-Unit-Test.cs#L77)   

#### InhibitionRadius: 
The inhibition radius determines the size of a column's local neighborhood. A cortical column must overcome the overlap score of columns in its neighborhood in order to become active. This radius is updated every learning round. It grows and shrinks with the average number of connected synapses per column.
#### Wraparound:
 Determines if inputs at the beginning and end of an input dimension should be considered neighbours when mapping columns to inputs.

**Case1:** (LOCAL) Testing Min Duty cycles are updated as per the mathematical formula defined in UpdateMinDutyCycleLocal without wrap around

**Case2:** (LOCAL) Testing Min Duty cycles are updated as per the mathematical formula defined in UpdateMinDutyCycleLocal with wraparound

**Case3:** (GLOBAL) Testing duty cycles are updated as per the mathematical formula defined in CalcEventFrequency method with period 1

## 3. Observations

Results of the changing BoostFactor parameters are updated in the CSV files for further graph generation and analysis.

Case 1: In this case the boost value is kept 1.0 and duty cycle period value 50000. By changing max boost and duty cycle period the stability is attained at cycle=0153, i=82, cols=41, s=100 and we observed that initially the SDR is not representing complete values and the program is slow. When the boosting parameter is activated the SDR is representing complete values and the total time to complete the program is 46:00 minutes.

- Example: The below image shows the output and graphs show the output of Permeance values and active-Duty Cycles vs boost Factors.
